        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Say goodbye to ho-hum potato soup! Easy to prepare with ingredients you probably have on hand. Garnish with a pat of butter if desired. Best served with warm, crisp bread.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <li>6 russet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch cubes</li>
            <li>5 slices bacon, cut into 1/2-inch pieces</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>2 stalks celery, cut into 1/4-inch slices</li>
            <li>½ large onion, diced small</li>
            <li>20 baby carrots, cut into 1/4-inch pieces</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt, divided</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons freshly ground black pepper, divided</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 cups half-and-half</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups chicken broth</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon dried thyme</li>
            <li>⅛ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>1 dash ground nutmeg</li>
            <li>4 green onions, finely sliced</li>
            <li>1 dash paprika, or to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with water; bring to a boil. Cook until fork-tender, about 10 minutes. Drain.</li>
            <li>Place bacon in a large saucepan and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until crispy, about 8 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels. Pour out bacon grease.</li>
            <li>Melt butter in the saucepan over medium heat, scraping the bottom of the pan with a flat-edged wooden spoon. Add celery, onion, carrots, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper; cook and stir until tender, about 10 minutes. Sprinkle in flour; cook and stir for 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Pour half-and-half and chicken broth into the saucepan. Add potatoes, 1 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon pepper, thyme, cayenne pepper, and nutmeg. Bring to a boil, stirring frequently. Stir in bacon pieces. Reduce heat and simmer, stirring often, until flavors combine, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Ladle into serving bowls. Garnish with 1/2 teaspoon pepper, green onions, and paprika.</li>
