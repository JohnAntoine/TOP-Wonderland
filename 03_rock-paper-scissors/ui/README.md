# PROJECT 03: ROCK PAPER SCISSORS - GUI

Creating (Rock - Paper - Scissors) as a Desktop Graphical User Interface

## Description

Combining [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com/) and [Front End Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/), the [**Rock Paper Scissors**](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rock-paper-scissors-game-pTgwgvgH) challenge by [Front End Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) was used to transform the Rock Paper Scissors [JavaScript project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/rock-paper-scissors), part of [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com/)'s [Foundations](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations) course, from a **Console** based game to a **Graphical User Interface** game.

## Workflow

- The starter FronEndMentor `index.html` was used as a template to kickstart development.
- Most of JavaScript code was morphed to control HTML elements instead of relying on user text input.
- The project CSS was created from scratch to closely emulate the FrontEndMentor reference.
- All the graphics were provided as part of the FrontEndMentor challenge files.
